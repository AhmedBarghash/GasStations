# GasStations
BADR TASK


Problem Statement

You are required to develop an application that shows the nearby gas stations along with shortest
paths.

The application is expected to operate while the user is on the streets. The app should update its
content as the userâ€™s location changes. The app should use an API service to get the list of nearby
places. All places within 1 KM should be available.
The application should be a two-tabbed application, with a list in a tab and a map in a tab. The list
should show the gas stations sorted by their the distance to the user. The map should show the gas
stations with pin annotations. When the user taps on one of the annotations, it should display the
directions to the associated gas station.
